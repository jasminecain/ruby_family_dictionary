```

### Docs
[Ruby Hashes](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/Hash.html)

### Instructions
Define a hash that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.
```bash
my_family = {
    :sister => {
        :name => 'Krista',
        :age => 42
    },
    :mother => {
        :name => 'Cathie',
        :age => 70
    }
}
```
Produce output that looks like the following example.
Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
